// ── THE MENU YIELDS INSTEAD OF COLLIDING ─────────────────────────────────────
// Because the centered menu is ABSOLUTELY positioned it cannot push anything
// aside: past a certain width it simply runs underneath the chrome on either
// side, and being positioned it also wins the hit test, so the controls it
// covers stop taking clicks. Measured on the review build at 1280: the More
// button spanned 907→1025 and the design toggle began at 957, i.e. 68px of
// overlap and a dead toggle (owner 2026-08-21: "these overlap with learn and
// more going over the light/dark and chains — fix it by putting the profile
// and learn into the dropdown when overlapping").
//
// A BREAKPOINT CANNOT DECIDE THIS, which is why the old lg/xl guards never
// held: the bar's width is not a build-time constant. A claimed name adds
// Profile, a connected wallet adds the book readout and widens the account
// pill, and an operator's own link set changes it again. So this measures the
// three things that actually determine the answer — where the row's centre is,
// where the logo ends, where the control cluster begins — and steps entries
// into the More dropdown, cheapest first, until the menu fits between them.
//
// Each entry's width is cached while it is on screen, so a demoted entry's
// cost is still known when the window grows and it can be promoted back.
//
// AND IT SPENDS THE ROOM THE CHROME LEAVES. Centring on the ROW is what makes
// the collision arrive early: the logo is 173px and the control cluster 291px,
// so a row-centred menu is bounded by the NARROWER side and throws away ~118px
// of real estate on the left. When true centring would collide, the menu
// centres in the gap BETWEEN the two blocks instead — which is what closes the
// last 8px at 1280/1440, the width where demoting alone still left the menu
// touching the toggle. It only ever shifts when the alternative is an overlap,
// so a roomy window keeps the pristine page-centred menu.

// console, 'how much do I hold overall' means finding the nav." WHY it lands
// here: the header is the one surface every page keeps, so the Portfolio entry
// stops being only a signpost and becomes the readout. Your book should be
// reachable AND legible from anywhere, without a trip to the page to read one
// number.
//
// SAME GATE AS THE DESTINATION (BOOK_TOTAL_ENABLED) and mounted only for a
// connected wallet — never a readout for a page this operator turned off, and
// never a dead affordance. Every read lives inside this child for that reason:
// a visitor who has not connected pays for nothing.
//
// HONEST OR ABSENT: nothing renders until something priced actually came back.
// A first read in flight is a small pulse; a failed or unpriced read is nothing
// at all. Never $0, which in a header reads as "your book is empty".
//
// FROM XL ONLY: the centered menu is absolutely positioned, and at lg it
// already sits close to the wordmark and the wallet button (the collision
// defect noted at fullNavAt above), so this waits for the same headroom the
// roomier padding waits for. Phones never see it either: the desktop menu is
// hidden there and the fixed bottom tab bar is the primary navigation, which
// keeps its own Portfolio tab. Width is bounded on purpose — the readout hides
// when the claim badge is showing, so the entry carries at most one number and
// never grows wider than it already can today.

  // adds no duplicate reads; the N basket reads are fine pre-launch (indexer at
  // scale). The badge promises "claimable", so it carries claimableTotal —
  // pots still under a chain's crank floor (F-1) accrue but can't flush, and
