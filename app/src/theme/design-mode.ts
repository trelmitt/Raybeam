// THE VIEWER DESIGN MODE — a runtime, per-browser design switch (owner
// 2026-08-17: "build the switcher system, little toggle on menu, and ensure it
// works not just for colour but total design changes").
//
// It deliberately owns NO theming machinery of its own: it re-applies the
// operator's brand through applyBrand with the style swapped, which is the one
// seam that already changes EVERYTHING per style — colour tokens, structural
// vars (--st-* card/field/radii), fonts, `color-scheme`, the `data-style`
// attribute components and CSS branch on, and the brandchange event the WebGL
// surfaces re-read. A mode here is therefore as sweeping as a style is; the
// enterprise style carries its own structure, not a recolour.
//
// The operator's gradient/accent palette rides along unchanged (their brand is
// their brand in both modes); everything the PRESET owns — surfaces, ink,
// structure, scheme, type — swaps whole.
